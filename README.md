# Insurance Charges Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting insurance charges based on various factors such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, gender, and region. The goal is to develop machine learning models that accurately predict insurance charges using regression analysis techniques. 

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.

- **Preprocessing**: Categorical variables are converted into numerical representations using one-hot encoding. Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to bring them to a similar scale.

- **Model Building**: Various regression models are trained and evaluated to predict insurance charges, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search Cross-Validation is performed to optimize the hyperparameters of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, improving their performance.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

The project aims to demonstrate the application of regression analysis techniques for insurance charge prediction. While the primary goal is not to outperform betting website predictions, the project serves as a learning opportunity to improve understanding of regression analysis and machine learning model implementation.
